# Function to generate dashboard URLs for a given compose project name and device name.
# If the parameters are not provided, it tries to read them from the .env file.
# If the .env file is not found or the parameters are not set, it returns an error.
# The generated dashboard URLs are written to a file named "dashboards_URLs_<compose_project_name>-<device_name>.txt".
# The function uses the "docker ps" command to get the running containers and extract the port information.
# It then writes the URLs to the dashboard file if the port mapping is available.
# The function returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.
